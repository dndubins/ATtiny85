After monkeying round with the ATtiny85 chip long enough, I realized the internal clock is very approximate (10% accurate with factory settings). This might not be important, but if you need to time events accurately, it poses a problem, even over short timeframes. Do you have access to an oscilloscope? If you do, you are in luck. You can send out a pulsed square wave and tweak it, watching the "OSCCAL" value through the serial monitor piggy-backed on an Arduino Uno with blank sketch uploaded. You can then calibrate the wave to get the MCU within ~1% accuracy. This is much better! If that still doesn't do the job for you, consider an external crystal. However, the crystal will occupy two pins on the ATtiny85, leaving you with barely any remaining to do your bidding. If you don't have an oscilloscope, and you are trying to solve this problem, well then - go and get one!!! If you have gone this far down the rabbit hole, it's a tool you will use again. I promise!

This is the sketch I wrote to calibrate the ATtiny85 clock, after figuring out the timers.
