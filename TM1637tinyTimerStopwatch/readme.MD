This little sketch uses the TM1637 clock module as a lab timer. Set the time in increments of 1 minute using a momentary switch, and the sketch will beep a piezo when time is up. In between timing, the ATtiny85 goes to sleep and shuts off the TM1637 module, conserving battery life. Turn on the device while holding the momentary switch down for a stopwatch.
