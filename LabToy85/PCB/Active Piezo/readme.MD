These PCB files are for using an active 3-5V piezo buzzer (simpler, fewer components). This version does not have a microUSB port.

In this directory are the Gerber files I generated for my print. There are some extra holes placed on the board for a TO-92 package, and a resistor with a place for an LED. I put these on the board thinking about other things I could do with this little guy, but probably won't.

I created this PCB using CircuitMaker v1.3.0.

I printed the PCBs using http://jlcpcb.com.
